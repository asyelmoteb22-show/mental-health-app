import React from 'react'
// Imports the React library, which is essential for building React components. React provides the foundation for creating a user interface.
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom/client'
// Imports ReactDOM from react-dom/client, which provides methods for interacting with the DOM (Document Object Model) in a web browser. Specifically, it's used here to render the React application into the HTML.
import App from './App'
// Imports the App component from the ./App file. This assumes you have a file named App.jsx (or App.js) in the same directory, which defines the main component of your application.
import './index.css'
// Imports the styles defined in the ./index.css file. This line makes the CSS rules defined in that file available to your application, styling the components.

ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root')).render(
// This is the core line that renders your React application. Let's break it down:
// ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root')): This part finds the HTML element with the ID "root" in your index.html file (usually in the public folder). It then creates a React root for this element, which is where your React application will be rendered.
// .render(<React.StrictMode> <App /> </React.StrictMode>): This part renders the App component inside the React root.
  <React.StrictMode>
    <App />
  </React.StrictMode>,
